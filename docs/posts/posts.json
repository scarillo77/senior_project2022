    "contents": "\r\nMy project was to analyze the impact of the box office as well as the release of films in the United States before and after COVID-19. Since COVID-19 is a current problem affecting everyone around the world, I wanted to see at how it has affected the film industry. I saw first hand how it has affected theaters since day 1, and that is why I want to find out through research how it impacted the box office. I plan to use Box Office Mojo as well as the CDC Tracker to start with my data search. Wikipedia will also be a very helpful place for data. This project will help build my skills as a data analyst, using various visualization sites such as Power BI.\r\nWeek 1: I first collected data from a Wikipedia page that listed all the films impacted by COVID-19 and web scraped them through Python and then converted them into excel sheets.\r\nWeek 2: I then cleaned up and added new data from Box Office Mojo, however I found more accurate data in The Numbers site\r\nWeek 3-4: I then created an excel sheet with various sheets detailing the domestic box office from 2019 to 2022\r\nWeek 5-6: I continued to refine the data regarding the domestic box office provided by The Numbers\r\nWeek 7: I then downloaded the data for the COVID-19 for daily cases and deaths.\r\nWeek 8: I then created visualizations in Power BI to detail the data I collected in Excel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
